## Crafting a Resume That Gets You Noticed

Your resume is your first impression. It’s what recruiters and hiring managers see before they even think about calling you in for an interview. So, it’s worth spending some quality time here.

### 1. Keep It Clear and Focused

A clean, well-structured resume is easier to skim and shows professionalism. Use bullet points, clear section headers, and consistent formatting. One page is usually enough for your first job.

**Example structure:**

- Contact Information  
- Summary or Objective (optional but helpful)  
- Skills  
- Projects  
- Education  
- Experience (if any internships or freelance)  
- Certifications or Courses (optional)  

### 2. Tailor Your Resume for Each Job

It might sound tedious, but customizing your resume for each application can boost your chances. Read the job description carefully and highlight relevant skills and projects that match what the company is looking for.

### 3. Highlight Your Skills and Technologies

List the programming languages, tools, frameworks, and libraries you know. But be honest! Don’t put React if you’ve only glanced at it once.

**Example Skills section:**

```markdown
**Skills:** JavaScript (ES6+), React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Git, HTML5, CSS3, REST APIs
```

### 4. Showcase Projects Like a Pro

Since you might not have professional experience, projects are your goldmine. For each project, include:

- **Project name and link** (GitHub repo or live demo)  
- **Short description**: What it does, why you built it  
- **Tech stack**: What technologies you used  
- **Your role**: What parts you worked on or challenges you solved  

**Example:**

**Weather App** – [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app)  
A responsive web app that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays current conditions and a 5-day forecast. Built with React and styled-components. Implemented caching to minimize API calls.

### 5. Use Action Verbs

Start bullet points with verbs like "Built," "Developed," "Implemented," "Designed," "Optimized." It makes your resume sound dynamic and impactful.

## Setting Up a Portfolio That Shows Off Your Skills

Think of your portfolio as your personal developer showroom. Unlike a resume, it’s interactive and lets people see your work in action.

### 1. Choose the Right Platform

You can build your portfolio site from scratch (which is great experience!) or use platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or even portfolio builders like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

### 2. What to Include in Your Portfolio

- **About Me**: A short intro — who you are, what you’re passionate about. Keep it light but professional.  
- **Projects**: Highlight 3-5 well-done projects with descriptions, tech stacks, screenshots, and links to live demos and repos.  
- **Blog or Articles** (optional): Writing about what you learn can show communication skills and passion.  
- **Contact Info**: Make it easy to reach you — email, LinkedIn, Twitter, or a contact form.

### 3. Make It Visual and User-Friendly

Include screenshots or GIFs to show your projects in action. Use simple navigation. Remember, recruiters might check your portfolio on their phone, so make it mobile-friendly.

### 4. Show Your Code Quality

Link to your GitHub repos and make sure your code is clean and well-organized. Add README files that explain what the project does, how to install or run it, and any features or challenges.

**Example README snippet:**

```markdown
# Weather App

## Description  
A React app that displays weather information using OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features  
- Current weather and 5-day forecast  
- Search by city name  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Installation  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Run `npm start`  
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
```

## Interview Preparation Strategies to Land the Offer

Interviews can be nerve-wracking, but preparation is your secret weapon. Here’s how to go from “Uh-oh” to “Bring it on!”

### 1. Understand the Interview Format

Developer interviews typically include:

- **Technical Screening**: Online coding tests or phone interviews with algorithm problems  
- **Technical Interview**: Whiteboarding or coding challenges, system design (for juniors, usually smaller scale)  
- **Behavioral Interview**: Questions about teamwork, challenges, and culture fit

### 2. Sharpen Your Coding Skills

Practice common coding problems on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Focus on:

- Arrays, strings, linked lists  
- Sorting and searching  
- Recursion and dynamic programming basics  
- Understanding time and space complexity  

**Example problem: Reverse a string**

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

console.log(reverseString("hello")); // Output: "olleh"
```

### 3. Learn to Talk Through Your Code

During interviews, narrate your thought process. Explain what you’re doing and why. This helps interviewers understand your problem-solving skills even if you get stuck.

### 4. Prepare for Behavioral Questions

Common behavioral questions include:

- Tell me about a time you faced a challenge and how you handled it  
- Describe a project you’re proud of  
- How do you handle feedback?  

Use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers clearly.

### 5. Have Questions Ready for Them

Interviews are two-way streets. Asking thoughtful questions shows your interest and helps you figure out if the company is right for you.

Examples:

- What does a typical day look like for a junior developer here?  
- How does the team support learning and growth?  
- What are the biggest challenges the team is currently facing?

### 6. Practice Mock Interviews

Use platforms like [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) or [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) to practice live interviews with peers or mentors.
